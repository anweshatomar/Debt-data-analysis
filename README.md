# Debt-data-analysis
Analyzing debt data using machine learning models.


## BREIF DESCRIPTION: 

Analyzed mortgage and debt data to determine how an individual is affected by debt given their classification and uncover any disparities between groups.

Performed data pre-processing to eliminate outliers and replaced missing values.

Conducted feature selection to find the most important features.

Further analysis was done using the KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression, the three methods were then ensembled.


## TOP FINDINGS:

- Hospitalization status was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular mortality.
- KNN method outperforms the multivariable logistic regression model, which produced McFadden R2 values in the moderate range of 55-65%.
- The Decision Tree method produced the most accurate predictions of the outcome dead for men (77%), wheareas Random Forest produced the most accurate predicitons of the outcome dead for women (78.6%).
